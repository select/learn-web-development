#Text Editing 1

##Working with many files; better HTML editing

--
### Creating a project in Sublime Text 3
Open a folder: `File ▸ Open Folder...`

Create the project: `Project ▸ Save Project As..`

The project file can be saved anywhere (you do not have to save it inside your project). I recommend a base folder like `/home/falko/Coding/*.sublime-project`

--
### Navigating in the project 
One of the keyboard shortcuts that made Sublime Text such a huge success is the

<kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>P</kbd> fuzzy file search.

It allows you to quickly skip to any file in your project <br> and even jump to the right section using `@` in the search filed.

--
### Installing plugins with Package Control
Copy the installation code to your cipboard

https://packagecontrol.io/installation <kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>C</kbd>

Open the Sublime console `View ▸ Show Console`

Paste <kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>V</kbd> the code and let the installation run.

After restarting we are able to **install plugins**.

### Finding editor commands with a keyboard shortcut
While you can find most editor commands in the top menus,

<kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd><kbd>P</kbd> fuzzy command search.

Will give you faster and better access to all commands.

Try seaching for `install` you should find the `Package Control: Install Package` command.

### Plugins: Emmet, All Autocomplete
We want to install 2 packages, here is how we do it

Emmet <br>
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd><kbd>P</kbd> `install` <kbd>Enter</kbd> `emmet` <kbd>Enter</kbd>

All Autocomplete <br>
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd><kbd>P</kbd> … <kbd>Enter</kbd> `all auto` <kbd>Enter</kbd>

For the second plugin we did not even have to write `install` since it remembered our last command.
