# Genetics and Web Components
## How I invented web components 7 years ago

--
### Programming is the most fun
TI 81 challanges (Dr. med) Sebastian Balbach
Reading Steve Levy's "Hackers"

Programming is fun and entertainment.

--
### Conways game of life
Started studying Bioinformatics
My first Java course (Dr. Lars Knipping)
Learning object orientation
only source code
programming conways game of life

--
### On the search for artificial life
Neural networks are **artificial intelligence**, close enough, lets visit the course.

Monday at 8
Very dry math

--
### Neural networks
Hebbsche Regel
Backpropagation

Simple parts that create something fantastic

--
### StarLogo and agent based programming

--
### Genes encode all information of a lifeform

--
### All i know is web programming
HTML
CSS
PHP

I had no clue about JavaScript at that time.

--
### My idea for gene-programming
Source code is quite similar to genes.

Promoter  - coding region   - introns
PHP       - HTML            - CSS

Ok this coparison does not really work,\
but you get the idea.

### Setting up the Enviornment

--
### Essential genes of a web agent

--
### Other genes I created
Mitosis
Movement
Identification

--
### A list of super interesting genes
Trust with hashes and black lists.
Meiosis
Sensing
Access/ownership

--
### Web components are close but missing essential parts
Polymer
http://webcomponents.org/
React
Angular 2

--
### Meteor packages are genes

### Beyond Meteor
